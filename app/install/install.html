<h2>Install Guide:</h2>
<p>Release info found 
	<a href="https://github.com/Immington-Industries/way-cooler/releases">here</a>
</p><br />

<div style="width:50%;">
	<p><strong>Should be two ways to install:</strong> <br><br>
	
	<strong>1.</strong> 
	Copying an equvilent script to do curl “way-cooler.org/releases/latest/install.sh” -sSf | sh. It will download the tarred version from #2 and run the install script automatically.<br><br>
	
	<strong>2.</strong> 
	Downloading a tarred version of Way Cooler and its default client programs (e.g the background, the bar when it is complete, etc.). It will have an install script that the user can run.<br><br>
	
	<h3>Also...</h3>
	We should also consider having previous versions available, not just the previous. <br>If hosting the files becomes problematic, we can look into alternatives to getting the scripts/binaries to the end user.
